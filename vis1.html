          This is probably the most interesting of all the Visualizations. There's a simple question asked: is there a variation in max temperature recorded based on where you are in relation to the poles and the equator? 
          Common sense would inform us that it isn't that hot further north or further south from the equator. If you are more informed, you may know that the sun shines perpendicularly for most of the year along the equator, and the further you move away from the equator the less direct sunlight you receive. 
          Since the solar radiation from the sun is able to heat up the earth, it makes sense that the hottest temperatures would be recorded close to the equator.

         This is precisely what we see in this visualization. The overall shape of the data is parabaloid and the peak is pretty close to the equator. The max temperature, however is somewhere 20 degrees south of the equator. 
         This is interesting as it is most likely these are cities south of the Sahara desert in Africa or the Atecama Desert in South America.
         Another interesting trend is that the max temperature starts off much higher south of the Equator but goes much lower north of the Equator. This might be correlated with more large cities located in the Global North compared to the Global South. 
         One last observation is that the data points are much more concentrated close to the Equator while they are more spread out as we go further north or south. This may be because of the consistent sunlight received by the tropics which results in them all getting about the same amount of heat.
