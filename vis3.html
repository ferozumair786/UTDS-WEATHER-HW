          This graph is as cloudy and indescernible as the clouds themselves. It appears that there are multiple, horizontal lines forming from the data which indicates that there are cities across the globe with cloudiness levels varying greatly as well. 
          This doesn't necessarily mean there is no correlation, but more likely that there are multiple patterns hidden within this dataset that could be teased apart by looking at different factors.

        For example, if you live close to the equator, you could live around the Amazonian rainforest which is pretty much always covered by clouds that produce rain. However, you could also happen to be close to the Sahara desert which runs through the equator as well. It is probably nor covered with clouds very often given that it is a desert. 
        City location probably also makes a huge difference. Coastal cities may be mre likely to be cloudy compared to inland cities or vice versa. However, the locations of those cities has nothing to do with latitude and might have more to do with longitude. 
        Maybe a longitudinal comparison would shed more light, or it may also have the same result.
